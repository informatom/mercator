// This is a manifest file for the front subsite (which is your whole
// application if you don't have any subsites).  It will be compiled
// into including all the files listed below.  Add new
// JavaScript/Coffee code in separate files in the front directory and
// they'll automatically be included in the compiled file accessible
// from http://example.com/assets/front.js It's not advisable to add
// code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of
// the the compiled file.
